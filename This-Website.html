                <p>After exploring side projects for my own education, I wanted to have a portfolio of my efforts.
                I chose to stay away from any libraries in this case, as I felt it would prevent me from properly learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript.<br>
                This site is hosted on my AWS micro instance along with the Discord bot. Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/KingPPine/Website" target="_blank">click here</a> to see the full code on GitHub.</p>

                <p>The majority of the contents on this site are made in HTML and CSS. However, here's a cool expandable box done in Javascript:</p>
                <button type="button" class="collapsible">Open Collapsible</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Pretty cool, right? &#129299<br>
                    I also leveraged Google Fonts, and added a Favicon. The last thing that bothered me was the fact that the site wasn't secure.
                    I feel as though security is an important part of setting up a site, and did some more research online. I ended up finding out about "certbot", 
                    which would help automatically certify my site, and allow for auto-renewal options.
                    </p>

                    <p><img src="images/httpd conf screenshot.png" align="right">Things got a little tricky here, as the documentation was not geared towards AWS and I had to make a few attempts before finding success.<br>
                    In the end, I installed the <a href="https://github.com/albuild/snap" target="_blank">snapd package</a> on my instance 
                    so that I could leverage the <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/snap-apache" target="_blank">snapd / Apache guide</a> from Certbot.
                    I set up the service to auto-renew periodically to remove yearly manual upkeep.
                    Finally, I established a 
                    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16200501/how-to-automatically-redirect-http-to-https-on-apache-servers" target="_blank">redirect in httpd.conf</a> 
                    (under /etc/httpd/conf/) to ensure the https version of the site is being used at all times.
