                    <p>This stemmed from wanting to have a Minecraft Server for my friends and I to play 24/7<br>
                    Searching online for options, I found a lot of services that did this for a reasonable rental fee.
                    However, I was looking to keep complete control over the performance of the server as well as drive costs even further down if possible.</p>

                    <p>I ended up settling on Amazon EC2 instances, as the architecture is barebones (forcing me to use linux in a shell interface) 
                        but the Amazon tools around it provide many options.<br>
                    I started by creating a Medium Instance (4GB of RAM and 2 virtual CPUs), downloading the key locally and SSH'ing into the server.<br>
                    I had to get comfortable with chmod to grant the right permissions (or simply use sudo before a command) as well as <br>
                    <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/install-software.html" target="_blank">"yum" which is the Amazon package manager</a> 
                    (why you gotta be different, Amazon??).</p>

                    <p>For installing the latest Java package, I downloaded the .rpm file from Oracle. To make file transfer more efficient going forward, 
                    I downloaded WinSCP and set up the session profile. I moved the rmp over to the server with WinSCP and installed it with sudo yum install.<br>
                    Similarly, I downloaded and moved the Minecraft server file over to a newly created directory and successfully ran it for the first time</p>
                    
                    <p>However, at this point I would theretically need to have my shell session open 24/7 to keep the server running, 
                    and at $0.05 an hour that meant I would pay overy $35 a month for this. I was also the only one with the access to start / stop the instance, which defeated the purpose. 
                    My solution was to write a Discord Bot (<a href="Discord-Bot.html" target="_self">Here's my page on that</a>) to allow any user in my group to start / stop this server, 
                    as well shut down the server after 30 minutes of inactivity (leveraging Amazon's Cloudwatch metrics).</p>

                    <p>I started by adding a script in the instance's <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43056007/ec2-run-scripts-every-boot" target="_blank">startup folder</a> to boot the minecraft server automatically once the instance was started.<br>
                    This is in var/lib/cloud/scripts/per-boot/, and the script simply "CD's" to the correct Directory, and runs the java server file as root.</p>
                    <p>I also took the time to set up weekly backups for the instance, just for safety.</p>
                    <p>Considering we play 5-10 hours per week at most, this was able to successfully reduce the costs from $35 to under $5 a month 
                    which is cheaper and more reliable than other services offered online.<br>
                    Please see the Discord Bot page for more information on how accomplished this last part.</p>
